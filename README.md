# fnaf-ControlPanel
The multiplayer companion to the FNAF: Task Terminal. As a second player, use this control panel to trigger real-time ads and jumpscares on the main player's screen. This fan-made project uses HTML, CSS, and Socket.IO to create a live, interactive, two-player experience based on FNAF 6.
